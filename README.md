# Spammer Writer

This is just a project I made a while back because I was bored and having a class that writes a class that spams someone seemed really cool.

This class writes another class over this one, if ide is put on fullscreen and cursor and keypad is left alone after 5 seconds. 
The class it writes will spam someones messages if write cursor is put in the messages textbox.
I know there's way easier ways but I made it with only if statements and logic.

Sometimes if your computer is slow, the shift key will lag. Half of this class was written by itself so its really long and without comments.
